h_size = [16] (meaning a connection between input layer to output with 16 connections)

Results:

It is observed that the perfect solution on the training set doesn't guarantee a perfect solution on test set. But the above results are only for perfect solutions on the test set. The average reward of all runs was about 170 on the test set with an average of 100 iterations which took around 80s.
