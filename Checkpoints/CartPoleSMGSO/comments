This is done with plain mutation, and standard optimizer
sigma:0.1
pop_size:50
num_workers:3
learning_rate:0.001

h_size = [16] (meaning a connection between input layer to output with 16 connections)

Results:
180 iters with 334s runtime (wall clock)
x iters with ys runtime (wall clock)
x iters with ys runtime (wall clock)
x iters with ys runtime (wall clock)

Average:
x iters with ys runtime (wall clock)

It is observed that the perfect solution on the training set doesn't guarantee a perfect solution on test set. But the above results are only for perfect solutions on the test set. The average reward of all runs was about z on the test set with an average of x iterations which took around ys
